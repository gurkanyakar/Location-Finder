# Location-Finder

## 1- You need google map api key to run the code.
## 2- This code creates an HTML page that uses the Google Maps API to display a map of a location specified in an input field. When the user clicks the "Find Location" button, the code will use the Google Maps API to convert the address entered in the input field into latitude and longitude coordinates, and then use those coordinates to center the map on that location. If no address is entered, the map will default to showing Istanbul.
